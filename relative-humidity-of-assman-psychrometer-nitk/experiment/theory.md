### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Assman psychrometer consist of two thermometers, each inside a double wall duct of highly metal designed for minimizing radiative heating both by the direct sun and longwave radiation exchange between thermometer and surrounding tube. In addition the instrument is ventilated during measurement by a manually winded fan. It is driven by motor which may be selective or clock work, a fan dries air through ducts part bulb at speed of 3m/sec after about 2 min of running of fan, the wet bulb temperature become steady.

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Dry-Bulb Temperature :It is the temperature recorded by using a conventional thermometer. The thermometer without muslin cloth in the psychrometer records dry-bulb temperature. It just reads the ordinary temperature of the air and is a measure of sensible heat content of the air. Its unit is 째F or 째C or kelvin (K). </p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Wet-Bulb Temperature :It is recorded by thermometer having wet muslin cloth on its bulb. The temperature recorded is in general lower than dry-bulb temperature because of cooling effect of the evaporating water of wet muslin cloth. They are equal only when air is in saturation and no net evaporation of water from wet muslin cloth takes place. Wetbulb temperature can never be higher than dry-bulb temperature. From the definition point of view, it is defined as the temperature at which water vapor evaporating into the air can bring down the air in saturation adiabatically at that temperature. It is a measure of the evaporating capacity of the air. Its unit is 째F or 째C or kelvin (K).

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Concept of Wet-Bulb Temperature :The water molecules in the wet muslin cloth take up energy from the neighboring molecules and evaporate into the air. The evaporating molecules leave the thermometer surface with reduced energy. This causes depression in the temperature near the thermometer bulb. Thus, lower temperature is recorded. Thus, a difference between the temperature at the bulb and the atmosphere exists. This causes flow of heat from the air through convection. Initially this flow of heat from air to bulb with wet muslin cloth is slower than the rate of heat loss from the bulb with wet muslin due to evaporation. But, a stage comes when the rate of heat loss and rate of heat gained in the two opposite processes equal. At this point, no further depression in temperature of wet-bulb is observed. At equilibrium, the temperature of thermometer with wet muslin cloth on its bulb is taken as wet-bulb temperature.

Applications of psychrometer:

1. It give estimate of hygrometrical state of mine air especially inbye working of deeper mine having regard to its effects on comfort and working efficiency of men engaged.
2. In mine liable to spontaneous combustion increase in temperature and humidity of air may occur in vicinity of heating during the production of heating due to oxidation of carbonaceous matter.
3. A psychrometer may be used in conjunction without requirement to determine whether heating is taking place or not.
4. Psychrometrical surveys are under taken before deciding about air conditioning or artificial cooling in very hot and deep mine.
